# Sales_Insights_usingPowerBi-SQL
This is a comprehensive Sales Insight Dashboard which I have created using Power Bi and SQL. The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize sales data for a retail company to uncover meaningful insights and support data-driven decision-making.

This project showcases my skills in data extraction,SQL-based transformations, data modelling and Power Bi visualization.

This project delivers the insight the Retail Company seeks in order to analyse the following:
a) Its retail-sales over the period of 4 years. 
b) The markets which have under-performed, moderately-performed and those who are performing well
c) The project also highlights its top customers 
d) The project also showcases the top products which have performed well in the market 
e) Product-wise, location-specific and customer-specific analysis 

Hence, these key insights have been the main focus deliverables.
